Filter
Filters are used to search and retrieve specific data from a data set based on certain criteria. In MongoDB we can use one type of filter, namely the find() method, to retrieve documents from the MongoDB collection based on certain criteria.
This will return all documents in the 'book shelves' collection that meet the given conditions.

Operator
In MongoDB, operators are symbols or keywords used in queries to perform specific operations on data in MongoDB documents. Operators are used to re¬trieve, change, or filter data in a query.
Example : lte, gte, gt, eq, and addtoset
$addToSet is an operator in MongoDB that is used to add elements to an array only if the element does not already exist in the array.
