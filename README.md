### add and subtract explain
* add is a function that is used to add a certain amount of time to an existing Moment object. we can specify the amount of time that we want to add along with the time units (such as year, month, day, hour, etc.)

* subtract is a function that is used to subtract a certain amount of time from an existing Moment object. How to use it is similar to add, but the amount of time given will be subtracted from the existing time

### start of and end of exlain

* In Moment.js, startOf and endOf are methods used to manipulate Moment objects by setting the time at the start or end point of a certain time unit.

* The startOf method is used to set the Moment object's time to the start of a specified time unit. we can use it to set a Moment object to the start of the day, month, year, hour, etc.

* The endOf method is used to set the time of the Moment object to the end of a specified time unit. we can use it to set a Moment object to the end of the day, month, year, hour, etc.
