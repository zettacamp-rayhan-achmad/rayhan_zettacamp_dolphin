### explain $unwind
In MongoDB, $unwind is an aggregation operation used to flatten an array in a document into several separate documents. This operation is useful when we want to perform an aggregation operation on the elements in the array, so that each element in the array becomes a separate document in the aggregation results. $unwind is very useful in situations where we want to perform aggregation operations on each array element individually. in my case, we want to separate all books from the shelves. so we can use $unwind
